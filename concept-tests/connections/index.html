  <h1>Connection Concept</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Simple Mechanism</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>In the arrangement global: create a beacon to signify that an arrangement exists</li>
      <li>In the custom element, create an iframe and immediately call `connectToChild`</li>
      <li>During expose <em>on the fragment</em> call `connectToParent` if (and only if) the arrangement global beacon answered earlier. ...if we have an arrangement</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Connection should be fine like this, but how do we handle a context to do something useful?</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Static Context</h2>
    <p>
      The old mechanism avoided a big problem by keeping the parent context as a static variable on the custom element.
    </p>
    <p>Now `static` does always smell a bit. But can/should we do that again?</p>
    <p>Are there better options?</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>How the connection between arrangement and fragment should work:</p>

    <p>The connection should be mediated be the custom element, since that is the point where I am in the parents code context but acually know about a specific child I want to connect.</p>

    <p>A successful connection should then augment the childs context with stuff from the parent.</p>

    <h3>Problems:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>if the context is not global, then how can we get hold of it in the custom element</li>
    <li>exactly HOW do we modify that context and what is the result</li>
    <li>how do we keep a separation of domains? We don't want to know about configuration or services at this point.</li>
  </ul>
  
    <h3>Possibilities</h3>
  <p>Maybe use a custom event for which we can initiate event handlers (with bubbeling) during expose?</p>
    <p>Maybe the custom element listens for a specific postMessage call that should get sent by the contained document IF it is a collage fragment. If such a message occours, the listener will:</p>
