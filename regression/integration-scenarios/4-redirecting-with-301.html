  <p>Composite frontends may often choose to redirect to their actual fragment urls from a url on their origin server.</p>
  <p>This way arrangements can have easier control over the sources of their fragments.</p>
  <p>Since actual frontends need to load even more resources, this is often done not via a serverside rewrite, but with a 301 redirect</p>
  <p>In our case, our fragment is configured to be at <code>/redirect/...</code> which will then redirect (301) to the real server at port 8081</p>
  <collage-fragment url="/redirect/test/edge-cases/fragment"></collage-fragment>
  <p>This currently times out at Context.ts:1005:14</p>
