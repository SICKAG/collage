  <h1>Using native iframes and redirects</h1>

  <p>Leaning on the redirect case (number 4) we must deem it normal that somebody would want to implement a micro frontend as a redirected url and put that thing in an iframe.</p>
  <p>This should also work, regardless of wether the integrated microfrontend is a collage frontend or not.</p>
  <iframe src="/redirect/test/edge-cases/fragment"></iframe>
