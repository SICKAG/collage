    <p>There are scenarios in which calling `expose` may be delayed until a 
      later time</p>
  </div>
  <p>If <code>data-await-theme</code> is set on an element, we want 
    anti-flickering to start taking effect as soon as possible on that 
    specific element, meaning that the element may bemain hidden until expose 
    is called.
